# Fizz Buzz Kata

This is the simplest project ever for starting with TDD.

## Rules
- Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number

## How to use this repo

This repo has multiple branches for showing the progress of the TDD technique:
- step_1_xxxxxx
- step_2_xxxxxx
- etc.

Each branch contains a description `STEP_DESCRIPTION.md` of the current branch exposing which decisions are taken.

## TDD way to go

In order to complete this exercise we're going to apply this process:
1. Check for refactoring (if available).
2. Choose a rule (or a part of it).
3. Write a test with a clear expectation.
4. Solve the expectation with the less effort you need.
5. Commit
6. Restart from point 1
