# Step 5 - Using classes instead of functions

All the logic is still encapsulated in functions inside the tests.
We need to create classes and use them in our application.

## TODO List:
- [ ] Refactor the tests for instantiate objects and calling methods instead of calling functions.
- [ ] Make sure the tests are not compiling
- [ ] Make sure it compiles, but the tests are still failing
- [ ] Move the logic in classes
- [ ] The tests should pass
- [ ] Commit
